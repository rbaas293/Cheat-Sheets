### Create a new Local branch based on your current checked out branch
```Shell
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```
* At this point you would edit/add files to your new branch and then commit the changes.
### Push your branch to the remote repository:
```Shell
git push -u origin <new-branch-name>
```
